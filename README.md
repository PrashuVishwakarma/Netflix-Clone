This project focuses on building a front-end replica of the Netflix user interface, mimicking its visual style and interactive elements. Here's what you'll be building:

Key Components:

Navigation Bar: A persistent navigation bar at the top allowing users to browse between sections like Home, Browse, Search, and My List.
Hero Banner: A large banner showcasing featured content (movies/shows) with captivating visuals and calls to action.
Content Rows: Rows displaying different categories of content with tiles (thumbnails, titles) representing individual movies or shows.
Playback Controls (Optional): A basic video player interface showcasing playback controls like play/pause, volume, and progress bar (assuming static images are used for content).
User Interface Elements (Optional): Include elements like search bar, user profile dropdown, and hover effects for content tiles.
Technical Stack:

HTML: Provides the structure and foundation of the web page.
CSS: Responsible for styling the various components, replicating the look and feel of Netflix. Frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS can be used to accelerate the process.
JavaScript (Optional): While not essential for a basic clone, JavaScript can be used for simple enhancements like animation effects on hover, smooth scrolling transitions, or basic interactions with search functionality.
Deliverables:

Static HTML file: The primary web page structure.
CSS files: Styling the different components of the UI.
Optional elements: JavaScript code for basic interactivity or dynamic elements.
Learning Objectives:

Gain experience with building user interfaces using HTML and CSS.
Learn to replicate and adapt existing web design styles.
Understand the importance of responsive design for different screen sizes.
(Optional) Practice basic JavaScript for interactive elements.
Focus on Front-End:

Remember, this project is focused solely on the front-end aspects, replicating the visual experience of Netflix. Backend functionalities like video streaming and user accounts won't be implemented here.
